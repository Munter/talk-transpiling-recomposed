## What i believe

I have spent a lot of time thinking about build tools.

This year I have spent more time thinking about how to make tools simpler for the next generation. Partially because I'm mentoring more, but also for more personal reasons.

Given this focus, teaching newcomers, let me start out with a bold statement.

Transpiler tooling is a problem (example of transpilers). Transpilers themselves are awesome unixy doing-one-thing-well tools. But the way we wrap them is problematic.

Lets me explain


## The problem

I believe that task runners, as a concept, are a fundamentally wrong abstration to transpiling.

I also believe that task runners were a very important foundation for tools to evolve around.

I think we are caught in a local optimum and that we need new ideas to improve.

## Ideal setup

- No configuration of integration
- On demand transpiling
- Doesn't require a full ecosystem
- Plays well with other tools
